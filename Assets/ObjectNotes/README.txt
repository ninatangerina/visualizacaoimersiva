Object Labels / Notes
=====================

V3.0

How to use:

First, import the package

1 - Select an object to add a label to

2a - Select 'Object Notes > Object Note' from the 'Component' menu
2b - Or, if you want to have notes that appear in your built game, select 'Object Notes > Object Note In Game Build' from the 'Component' menu
(If you don't use the 'In Game Build' version, it won't cost any performance in your built game)
Beware: this feature is still meant for debugging and testing purposes, usage in your actual game is not recommended and at your own risk

3 - Type a note and/or select an image, customize as you wish.

4 - If the Object Note is the only component with an icon, you way want to hide the Gizmo icons: go to the Gizmos menu at the top of the Scene View and click the icons next to ObjectNote and ObjectNoteInGame.

Note: You can move the 'ObjectNotes' folder anywhere in your folder structure.

Enjoy!
